There is no way apply a Vnet to an existing HDInsight cluster — a new cluster will need to be deployed which is connected to a virtual network. See below for steps:

1.	Create a new Network Security Group (if a desired NSG does not already exist):
	a.	After logging in to the Azure portal, navigate to the "Network Security Groups" service.
	b.	Click "+ Add" at the top to create a new Network Security Group.
	c.	Choose a name and Resource Group for your new NSG.
	d.	Create the NSG.
	e.	Navigate to the newly created NSG in the portal, and select "Inbound Security Rules"
	f.	Click "+ Add" to add a new Inbound Rule.
	g.	Create a new rule allowing inbound traffic over TCP port 443 according to Azure guidance: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/hdinsight/hdinsight-management-ip-addresses

2.	Create a new Virtual Network (if a desired Vnet does not already exist):
	a.	Navigate to the "Virtual Networks" service.
	b.	Click "+ Add" at the top to create a new Vnet
	c.	Create a new Vnet and subnet with desired settings. Take note of the new Vnet’s name

3.	Attach the subnet you created in Step 1 to your newly created Subnet within the Vnet:
	a.	Navigate to the Virtual Network you created in Step 2.
	b.	Click "Subnets" and select the Subnet you wish to attach your NSG to.
	c.	Under the "Network Security Group" drop-down menu, select the NSG you created in Step 1.
	d.	Click "Save".

4.	Re-deploy the HDInsight cluster into the newly created Vnet:
	a.	Navigate to the "HDInsight clusters" service.
	b.	Click "Create HDInsight cluster"
	c.	On the "Security + networking" section of the deployment, under "Virtual Network", ensure the Vnet and Subnet you created in Step 1 is selected.
	d.	Proceed with creating the cluster.
